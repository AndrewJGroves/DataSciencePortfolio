# Portfolio

This repository is designed to try and demonstrate my ability to do data analysis and data science projects. Some of the projects have come from Codecademy while others will be my own. This will mainly focus on Machine Learning as my PhD demonstates data analysis.       
There is also the [repository](https://github.com/AndrewJGroves/IBMCaptoneProject) which was created to complete the IBM data science course. These demonstrate a series of skills needed for data science.

## Personal Projects
### Machine Learning
**HousingPrice**                   
Using regression to predict housing prices. I demonstrate tuning of hyperparameters, data cleaning, pipelines and simple stacking.       
**Titanic Survial**       
Classification project on titanic survial rate with explainations included          
**MedicalCost**                 
Using regression based on HousingPrice to estimate the costs of submitted to insurance firms            
**LaptopPrice**     
Using regression, multiple and linear, to find the price of laptops.         
**Iris**       
Using the Iris dataset to get experience with classification. It also includes a first look at kMeans clustering.            
**mnist**               
Using the mnist dataset to learn classification          


### Other
**NuclearMissle**       
Using the Wikipedia package to extract the nuclear missile information from Wikipedia. Then importing them to a data frame, plotting them and then making a matplotlib movie on progression.   

## Codecademy Projects
### Machine Learning    
**YelpRegression**           
Using regression, multiple and linear, to predict what yelp factors correspond to good overall ratings             
**DateAScientist**                 
Testing classification algorithms to predict the star sign on fake dating website    
**ViralTweets**      
This using the classifcation kNN algorithm to try and predict if a tweet is viral       
**TweetLocation**       
This uses Naive Bayes Classifier to try and predict the location of tweets

### Other
**USMedicalInsurance**                 
Looking into US medical Insurance to demonstrate using python            
**Biodiversity**          
Examining biodiversity to demonstrate using Pandas for exploratory data analysis            
**LifeExpectancy**          
Using life expectancy and GDP to demonstrate various plotting methods
