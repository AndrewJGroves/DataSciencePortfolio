# Portfolio

This repository is designed to try and demonstrate my ability to do data analysis and data science projects. Some of the projects have come from Codecademy while others will be my own.       
There is also the [repository](https://github.com/AndrewJGroves/IBMCaptoneProject) which was created to complete the IBM data science course. These demonstrate a series of skills needed for data science.

## Codecademy Projects
### Machine Learning    
**YelpRegression**           
Using regression, multiple and linear, to predict what yelp factors correspond to good overall ratings             
**DateAScientist**                 
Testing classification algorithms to predict the star sign on fake dating website    
**ViralTweets**      
This using the classifcation kNN algorithm to try and predict if a tweet is viral       
**TweetLocation**       
This uses Naive Bayes Classifier to try and predict the location of tweets

### Other
**USMedicalInsurance**                 
Looking into US medical Insurance to demonstrate using python            
**Biodiversity**          
Examining biodiversity to demonstrate using Pandas for exploratory data analysis            
**LifeExpectancy**          
Using life expectancy and GDP to demonstrate various plotting methods            

### Notes
Not all data is included for Codecademy projects
## Personal Projects
### Other
**NuclearMissle**       
Using the Wikipedia package to extract the nuclear missile information from Wikipedia. Then importing them to a data frame, plotting them and then making a matplotlib movie on progression.
