    "This is a python package that is used to solve convex optimization problems. A optimization problem is when you have a action (e.g. rescoruse allocation), some constraits (e.g. Number needed) and a outcome. This method can be applied to alot of problems however almost all are unsolvable, with a exection being convex problems. A convex problem is when the constraints are linear, and the outcome has none negative curvature.     \n",
